## Introduction

::: columns
::: {.column width="70%"}
FUME focuses on understanding the patterns, motivations and modalities of migration at **multiple geographical scales**, from international through regional to the local level, and on imagining possible futures scenarios of migration to Europe.

These scenarios will be shared with the EU Commission, international organizations, national states, and regional and local governments.

## Objective

-   Project future population of EU + UK (EU28)
-   Population projection with **country of birth** (CoB) in addition to **age**, **sex** and **education**
-   FUME goal of creating possible futures scenarios of migration to Europe

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Projection model

1.  EU28 countries with a full four-dimensional model
2.  Rest of the world with a three-dimensional model + diaspora distribution
3.  Extend the Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) /Wittgenstein Centre for Demography and Global Human Capital (WIC) projection model 
4.  Migration component developed by Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Why is country of birth important?

- Does the migration pattern differ by country of birth? 
- Total migration flow  = Diaspora (stock) + GDP  (Rikani and Schewe, 2021; FUME partner PIK)  
- Diaspora: inertia and return migration, Characteristics of migrants (Age, Sex, and Education)?
- Does demographic behavior change after migration?

## Data - Mortality

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Mortality rates from WIC, by age, education, country of residence
-   Mortality by country of birth - in Sweden - **smaller differences than between education**
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Data - Fertility

-   Fertility rates from IIASA/WIC
-   Education and age-specific fertility rates by country of residence
-   **No evidence of fertility differing by country of birth after accounting for level of education**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Data - Education

-   IIASA's country specific educational transitions, by age
-   **Evidence of difference in educational attainment transitions by country of birth**
-   Transition probability from upper secondary to post secondary (e56) is **higher among non-host** in almost all countries of the EU (some exceptions Malta and Spain)

## Quantitative migration scenarios

::: panel-tabset
### Scenarios

-   Different scenarios are produced to account for the uncertainty in the projection
-   Global migration scenario narratives are based on the qualitative and quantitative migration evidence collected by other FUME partners, including an expert survey conducted by NIDI and a Delphi survey by the University of Manchester.

### Benchmark

Identical to SSP2 (Shared Socioeconomic Pathways) from Koch & Leimbach (2022), including COVID shock but not Ukraine war.

### Short-war

Same as benchmark scenario but using the IMF estimate (International Monetary Fund, 2022) until 2027, then linear transition over 5 years back to SSP2 growth rates.

### Scenario B

**Recovery in Europe, stagnation in developing countries**: Same as short-war scenario, but instead of all countries transitioning to SSP2, European countries transition towards the SSP in which they have the highest growth rates; while developing countries (including emerging economies) transition towards the SSP in which they have the lowest growth rates. These might be different SSPs for different countries. All other countries (e.g. USA, Australia etc.) transition towards SSP2.

### Scenario C

**Rise of the East**: Same as Scenario B, but opposite European countries transition towards the SSP in which they have the lowest growth rates; while developing countries (including emerging economies) transition towards the SSP in which they have the highest growth rates. All other countries (E.g. USA, Australia etc.) transition towards
